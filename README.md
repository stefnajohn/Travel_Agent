# Travel Agent
An AI-powered Travel Planner Agent designed to help users plan trips efficiently by providing personalized recommendations, real-time updates, and seamless booking assistance.It uses real-time data to suggest destinations, build itineraries, and recommend transport and accommodation options.

## Problem Statement
Modern travelers face overwhelming complexity when planning trips, juggling destination research, price comparisons, accommodation bookings, transportation options, and real-time variables like weather and delays. Current solutions (booking websites, static guides) lack personalization, real-time adaptability, and unified management, resulting in stressful, inefficient planning experiences.​

## Proposed Solution
